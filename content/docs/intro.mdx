# Introduction

Welcome to **Lunar Kit** 🌙 — a comprehensive UI component library for React Native applications, built with **NativeWind** (Tailwind CSS for React Native).

## What is Lunar Kit?

Lunar Kit is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable UI components for React Native. It provides everything you need to build modern mobile applications with a consistent design system.

### Key Features

- 🎨 **Beautiful Design** — Clean, modern components following best practices
- 🌙 **Dark Mode Support** — Built-in theme switching capabilities
- 📱 **Cross Platform** — Works on iOS, Android, and Web
- ⚡ **NativeWind Powered** — Leverage Tailwind CSS utility classes
- 🔧 **Customizable** — Easy to extend and modify
- 📦 **Copy-Paste Ready** — Components are added directly to your project
- 🎯 **TypeScript First** — Full type safety throughout
- ♿ **Accessible** — WCAG compliant components

## Why Lunar Kit?

Unlike traditional component libraries that are installed as npm packages, Lunar Kit follows the **copy-paste** approach (inspired by shadcn/ui). This means:

1. **Full Control** — Components live in your project, so you can modify them freely
2. **No Lock-in** — You're not dependent on library updates or breaking changes
3. **Learn & Understand** — See exactly how each component is built
4. **Customize Everything** — Change styles, behavior, or structure as needed

## Philosophy

Lunar Kit is built with these principles in mind:

### Composition Over Configuration

Components are designed to be composed together rather than configured through props. This gives you more flexibility and makes the code more readable.

```tsx
// ✅ Composition approach
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Welcome</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Get started with Lunar Kit</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <Text>Your content here</Text>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### Variants with CVA

We use `class-variance-authority` (CVA) for handling component variants. This provides type-safe variant management with excellent developer experience.

```tsx
// Button variants example
<Button variant="default">Primary</Button>
<Button variant="outline">Outline</Button>
<Button variant="ghost">Ghost</Button>
```

### NativeWind Integration

All styling is done through NativeWind, making it easy to customize using familiar Tailwind CSS classes.

```tsx
<Button className="mt-4 w-full">
  Full Width Button
</Button>
```
